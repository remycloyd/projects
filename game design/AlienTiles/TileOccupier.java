/* A tile occupier can be a block, pickup, or a sprite,
   which is indicated by its type.

   A tile occupier has a unique name, a tile coordinate
   (xTile, yTile), and a coordinate relative to
   the top-left corner of the floor image (xDraw,yDraw)
   where it should be drawn.

   Drawing involves adding an offset to the occupier's floor
   coordinate since the floor will have moved as the player
   apparently moves. 

   A sprite draws itself, and must be positioned in
   the JPanel first.
