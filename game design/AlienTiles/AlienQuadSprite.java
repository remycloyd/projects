/* A subclass of AlienSprite.
   It overrides:
      void playerHasMoved()   -- called when the player has moved
	  void move()             -- move the alien

   This alien calculates a quadrant direction for the sprite 
   (NE, SE, SW, NW). The calculation is repeated made whenever 
   the player moves.

   The direction is obtained by finding the nearest pickup
   point to the player, then finding that pickup's quadrant
   position relative to the alien.

   This gives the alien a 'pickup guarding' behaviour, where an
   alien moves to guard the pickup that the player is heading
   towards.
